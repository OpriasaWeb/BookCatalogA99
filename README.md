# Book Catalog


Hi!

I am your applicant, sorry I wasn't able to finish the exam due to JS CDN problem. I stuck there for the time being, but my code structure on backend side is solid and followed the OOP principles. Whether this project is accepted or not, I will continue on this by tomorrow. 



Thank you.
