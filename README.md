Hi!

I hope everyone is fine, here is my project, actually a coding project exam as I apply for a web developer position in a certain company, and here is the title of the assigned project: Book Catalog, Project 2 this year so far.

Here are the few technologies that I worked on in this project:
PHP, Bootstrap, JS, JQuery, Ajax, HTML, CSS, and MySQL.
